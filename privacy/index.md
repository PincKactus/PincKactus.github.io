# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: {{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}_

I run this site to share projects like **Kactus Force** and **Focus Remastered**. Here’s how I handle data:

## What I collect
- **Form submissions**: When you contact me, I receive the fields you submit (name, email, message).
- **Basic analytics**: If Netlify Analytics is enabled, I see page views, top pages, referrers, etc. These are privacy-friendly aggregate metrics (no cookies).
- **Downloads**: Files are hosted on this domain; standard server logs record basic request data (IP, user agent) for reliability/security.

## How I use it
- To reply to messages, improve the site, and understand which pages/downloads are useful.

## Sharing
- I don’t sell your data. Third-party processors used: **Netlify** (hosting, forms, analytics) and **GitHub** (source hosting).

## Security
- I use HTTPS and keep dependencies updated. No system is perfect—report any issues via the contact form.

## Your choices
- You can request deletion of your form submission by contacting me.
- Don’t submit private or sensitive info through the form.

## Questions
Reach me via the [contact form]({{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}).
